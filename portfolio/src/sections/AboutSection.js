      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Barbara, and I am a frontend developer and UI/UX designer
        based in south Florida. I have been designing and building web products
        for over 1 year, and in that time I have produced simple web
        applications, such as a weather and forecast website, to more advanced
        web applications that helped increase customers for local businesses. I
        am a self-taught developer and designer, which indicates my dedication
        and drive to achieve the results I expect.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I am not on my computer working on my latest project, I enjoy
        long-distance running, cooking, and reading both fiction and non-fiction
        books.
      </p>
      <h3>My Skills</h3>
    </div>
